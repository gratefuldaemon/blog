# There&rsquo;s plastic everywhere and in everything

A common view is that there is no point in caring about microplastics because it&rsquo;s a hopeless situation, this is not only ill-informed but also myopic - the vast majority of microplastics we ingest come from a few easy to control sources.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s microplasics everywhere so why even bother trying to limit your consumption&rdquo; should be mocked to the same extent as &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go outside without being exposed to vape smoke so you may aswell start vaping yourself&rdquo; It&rsquo;s near certain that microplastics are a net negative to your health so you absolutely should limit consumption.

# What you should know

For the average person most microplastics they ingest come from (in order)

1.  Seafood
2.  Plastic storage
3.  Inhalation
4.  Misc produce

# Practical takeaways

Considering this it&rsquo;s actually very low effort and quick to eliminate the vast majority of microplastics

-   (1) is self evident, limit your intake of seafood (sea salt is very high in microplastics as well so if you don&rsquo;t have issues with it synthetic table salt might be better)
-   (2) is things like plastic bottles and reheating food in plastic containers, plastic storage should be a concern when either (a) the plastic is flexible each time it flexes it leaches microplastics so things like plastic water bottles are obviously bad (b) hard plastic, things like tupperware are bad when they&rsquo;re frozen or heated but can be easily swapped out for some borosilicate glass containers since they&rsquo;re durable, microwave safe and stop your food coming into contact with plastic - so swapping for a reusable water bottle (tap water is way lower in microplastics and in a lot of parts of the UK microplastics are filtered out, the vast majority of the UKs tap water also isn&rsquo;t fluridated making it a pretty good choice even without additional filtering)
-   (3) This is mostly a product of living in a plastic dense environment and not going otuside, that being said even disregarding microplastics investing in a [Air purifier](https://www.cleanairkits.com/products/exhalaron?variant=49803333665068) that&rsquo;s HEPA and has high efficiency means you can leave it running 24/7 at low cost and high yield - most consumer air purifiers are terribly designed then avoid microfibre bedsheets and opts for cotton or bamboo instead since it&rsquo;s a flexible plastic you roll around on for 8 hours a day - in terms of clothing avoiding plastic clothing is probably a good idea but in my estimation more effort than it&rsquo;s worth (polyester is the most common plastic clothing you&rsquo;ll find)
-   (4) is mostly vegtables and fruit, easily remidied by rinsing under the tap, which you should do regardless for the pesticide risk.
