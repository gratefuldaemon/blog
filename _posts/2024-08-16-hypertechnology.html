<p>Hypertechnology</p>
<p>===============</p>
<p>Hypertechnology is all encompassing, devouring you as a human because all experiences can be had within this one thing, all your senses can be stimulated through it, through this eventually sense data from the real world becomes secondary to the stimulation provided by the hypertechnology, you lose track of sound, time, physical sensation then after enough when you disengage with the hypertechnology you realise that you&rsquo;d forgotten the world existed, much like coming out of a deep meditation session. This experience can only be offered by hypertechnology and it&rsquo;s how you distinguish between hyper/technology. How you engage with the device itself changes if it&rsquo;s (hyper)technology or not, though some devices (such as VR) can only ever be hypertechnology, others like a smartphone are transformed into it by engrossing activities like social media, desktop computers quickly turn hyper thanks to noise cancelling headphones.</p>

<p>As time goes on more technology has become hyper, not because of necessity but because of profit, having a person forget anything else exists to the point where when they come to they&rsquo;re dehydrated and hungry that is a financial goldmine, to become that engrossed in a product or service is similar to forcing someone to engage with your product. Most people are forced into this technosis on a regular if not daily basis, not voluntarily, but essentially by force, this time spent in technosis, without organic feeling without organic thought is mostly time wasted, time spent not alive in a meaningful way - now this can be useful and productive - a programmer with noise cancelling headphones, edm playing and a steady drip of caffeine is in a state of technosis - but this person decided to be there; Most people aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The involuntary technosis is harmful because it reduces you and your ability to make choices, you&rsquo;re being taken over and not even realising.</p>
