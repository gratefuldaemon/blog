<h2 id="accelerationism">Accelerationism</h2>
<p>
    Accelerationism is seen as either a hateful, aggressive militant ideology or
    as a natural forming process - as complexity increases, capacity follows
    then it’s only natural that things will get quicker. Some argue acc started
    with marx others argue it started with land I’m of the view marx was the
    origin and land was the form (though nick land should no longer be taken
    seriously, he now just boomer posts on twitter, at this point it’s not even
    worth reading his work directly since it’s explained in other works in a
    much more accessable form) Marx saw acc as a function of capitalism that
    could be stopped, overcame. Land saw it as unstoppable so embracing it is
    all that’s left - since then people have expanded it further - the most
    fitting analogy is that of a train, we’re sat on a train marxs looks out the
    window and notices it’s speeding up with no chance of stopping, he looks
    further down the track and sees the tracks ending, he wants the train to be
    slowed down and hopefully stopped - land looks out of the window and reaches
    the conclusion the train will only ever speed up so we should try and speed
    it up as much as possible to get it over and done with.
</p>
<p>
    Extended from this is the idea of “clearing the pit” the train gets so much
    speed it’s existing momentum at the moment of derailing might keep us going
    until we either land on another track or until we can build one.
</p>
<p>
    One common myth is that accelerationism is right leaning, this was not true
    of marx and (kind of) wasn’t true of nick land or the CCRU - included in
    accelerationism is l/acc seeking to reach automated luxery communism, g/acc
    seeking to abolish the concept of gender, xenofeminism seeking to use
    capitalism and acc to remove gender inequality to establish true feminism.
    CCRU was a very left leaning group and most if not all excluding land went
    on and continued to be incredibly impactful left leaning thinkers, two
    recognisable cases being sadie plant and mark fisher - claiming acc as right
    leaning wipes out all of the wokr done and being done by left leaning
    thinkers - just because right leaning people dominate acc spaces on twitter
    doesn’t mean they are the ideology, as is mostly the left has allowed the
    right to claim ownership over some thing that should rightfully belong to
    the left.
</p>
<p>
    This should hopefully give enough of a background into acc that the rest
    logically follows.

<h2 id="criticism-of-xacc">Criticism of (x)/acc</h2>
<p>
    The issues with most acc subgenres is they lack coherence, formal value sets
    and any actual structure - they mostly fall into the catagory of thing/acc
    with no actual considerations A logical prerequesit (that I’m currently
    violating) should be to write an outline of your thing/acc before you can
    put it in your twitter name or bio - watch almost any interview with
    accelerationists and you’ll see quickly how they’ve never thought about what
    it actually means.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oj7m3F0ifI"
        >Beff explains eacc to lex</a
    >
</p>
<p>
    It’s obvious from this clip that beff could explain it in simple language
    but chooses not to, I agree with feynman if you can’t explain it to a layman
    you don’t have a good enough grasp on it - watch that entire clip then ask
    what should an e/accer actually do? it’s laid out a value set but not a
    formal structure, an interesting note on that vidoe is beff claims d/acc as
    a fork to e/acc but I don’t know why he beleives this from the opening lines
    of
    <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html"
        >the d/acc manifesto</a
    >
    he explains it’s meant as a response to andreessens techno-optimist
    manifesto which makes me question if beff has even read it, e/acc is barely
    mentioned - but this isn’t meant to be focused too much on beff but
    unfortunately he’s the central figure and most notable in acc spaces right
    now even though I honest to god do not know if he’s doing anything beyond
    posting on twitter, he talks like he’s incredibly important but I’ve yet see
    anyone point to a solid thing he’s done, he’s talked about how vital open
    source and working in public is to progress but is incredibly evasive about
    the things he’s doing/working on - I’m not making the claim he’s a liar or a
    scammer moreso just if it’s impossible to verify if someones doing something
    it’s concerning - from his use of language in the clip he is knowlegable
    about accelerationism and seemingly the ideas of deluze and the other one
    but that’s what makes it even more frustrating right now (x)/acc is going
    through such a level of decentralisation that it’s fracturing and now the
    power is distributed among too many nodes and it’s potential for power
    growth is highly limited due to people aprehension of AI - meanwhile tenents
    of k/acc continue to grow in the mainstream.

<h2 id="accelerationism-as-natural-process">
    Accelerationism as natural process
</h2>
<p>
    Look at human history and what you see is clear acceleration in all things,
    humans strive this striving causes creation and from creation comes
    complexity as complexity increases so does the potential for creation
    resulting in further complexity this process continues until the blissful or
    bitter end. But from complexity also comes a much faster rate of
    progression, of societal values, technology, human understanding,
    everything. it all requires a threshold level of complexity - this isn’t to
    say all forms of complexity are important and valuble, organic, inorganic
    and artifical all exist.
</p>
<p>
    This cycle is not just a characteristic of human ambition but a reflection
    of the fundamental laws of nature and evolution. Just as biological
    organisms evolve by adapting to their environments in increasingly complex
    ways, so too does human society evolve by creating and adapting to new
    technologies and ideas. This evolution is not linear but accelerates as each
    layer of complexity adds depth and speed to the process. The result is a
    world where changes that once took centuries now unfold in decades, if not
    years, reshaping our societies and selves at an unprecedented pace. Through
    this lens, accelerationism can be seen not merely as a socio-political
    theory but as an extension of the natural process of evolution, magnified by
    human consciousness and creativity.
</p>
<p>
    The acceleration of this process could lead to a tipping point where human
    society either adapts to its rapid pace of change or faces significant
    upheaval. This is where the concept of accelerationism becomes not just an
    observation but a critical framework for understanding and navigating the
    future. By embracing and accelerating these changes, rather than resisting
    them, humanity can harness this natural process for transformation. Through
    conscious effort and foresight, we have the potential to guide this
    acceleration in ways that promote sustainability, equality and well-being,
    seeing complexity not as a challenge but as an opportunity for unprecedented
    growth and advancement.
</p>
<p>
    In essence, the process of complexity highlights the interconnectedness of
    human innovation with the evolutionary forces of nature. It acknowledges
    that while the path forward may contain challenges, the same processes that
    drive complexity and change also hold the keys to our adaptation and
    flourishing in an ever-accelerating world. Things will get faster regardless
    of human action - humans just seemingly have the largest capacity to make
    things go faster but everything from a whale to an ant is making things go
    faster.
</p>
<p>
    As a small note here I want to point out complexity
    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> complicatedness,
    the design, manufacture and shipping of a toothbrush is highly complex, it’s
    also not complicated.

<h2 id="what-is-kacc">What is k/acc?</h2>
<p>
    k/acc or knowledge accelerationsim is a fundementally human centric approach
    to accelerationism - unless it furthers the goal of humans it is not
    included, an AI that irons clothes is disregarded, an AI that helps people
    learn is encouraged. k/acc is the belief that human conciousness is both
    unique and something we cannot replicate (though with sufficiant advancement
    we may come close), that a core part of that conciousness stems from
    knowledge and that knowledge in and of itself offers value in all aspects of
    life - it enables control over yourself, allows the world to be more
    interesting and almost every issue our species have faced and will face
    comes down to knowledge (or a lack of). Conflict and a lack of cooperation
    are no exception - without sufficiant knowledge nothing can be resolved. We
    are no more than an animal taking rough guesses based on memory and feelings
    - This has a hard limit on potential and our species overcoming this limit
    through knowledge is why we’ve come so much further.
</p>
<p>
    Underpinning k/acc is the conviction that technological advancements must
    pivot around enhancing human capabilities and consciousness. Technology
    should not merely aim to automate tasks but to augment human intellect and
    creativity, bridging the gap between what is and what could be. In this
    light, k/acc champions technologies and innovations that empower individuals
    to navigate, understand, and interact with the world in more profound and
    impactful ways. The emphasis is on tools that facilitate learning,
    comprehension, and the application of knowledge in solving real-world
    problems, thereby enriching human experience and potential. Things like
    intellectual property and copyright take a backseat to enhancing the ability
    for people to actualise knowledge (art being a form of applied knowledge).
</p>
<p>
    Central to k/acc is the idea that knowledge is not just power but the very
    foundation of progress and enlightenment. It is through the acquisition and
    application of knowledge that humans have the potential to be human. By
    fostering an environment where knowledge is freely accessed, shared, and
    applied, k/acc aims to catalyze a global movement towards a more human
    world. It is a call to action for all of humanity to embrace the pursuit of
    knowledge, not just as a means to an end, but as an end in itself.
</p>
<p>
    In essence, k/acc serves as a manifesto for a future where technology and
    human intellect converge in a harmonious pursuit of progress and
    self-actualization. It is a fever dream vision of a world where every
    individual is empowered to be.

<h2 id="why-kacc-has-to-be-the-first-step">
    Why k/acc has to be the first step
</h2>
<p>
    The imperative that k/acc, be the initial step in the broader
    accelerationist movement stems from its foundational belief that knowledge
    underpins all forms of human progress and societal development. This
    conviction is not just philosophical but practical; before any
    technological, social, or political acceleration can be effectively pursued,
    a comprehensive and deeply ingrained understanding of knowledge as both a
    resource and a capability must be established.
</p>
<p>
    Knowledge equips individuals and societies with the ability to make informed
    decisions. Without a profound and widespread understanding of the world, its
    complexities, and the potential consequences of our actions, attempts to
    accelerate in any domain are likely to be misguided, inefficient, or even
    harmful. True innovation requires a rich substrate of knowledge from which
    to draw. By prioritizing k/acc, we ensure that creativity and invention are
    not stifled by ignorance or limited perspectives. A society well-versed in a
    broad range of disciplines is better equipped to generate breakthroughs that
    can propel humanity forward in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
    The acceleration of technology and societal change brings with it a host of
    ethical dilemmas and moral considerations. This will hamper widespread
    adoption k/acc allows you to push accelerationism without ever sayign the
    word.
</p>
<p>
    Knowledge accelerationism fosters a sense of community and shared purpose.
    When individuals recognize the value of knowledge and its role in shaping
    the future, they are more likely to collaborate and contribute to collective
    endeavors. This unity is essential for the sustained, coordinated action
    required to navigate the challenges and opportunities of acceleration.
</p>

<h2 id="directive-of-kacc">Directive of k/acc</h2>
<p>
    The primary directive of k/acc, is to actively pursue and facilitate the
    unrestricted flow and enhancement of knowledge across all spectrums of
    society. This involves dismantling barriers to information accessibility and
    leveraging technological innovations to democratize education and
    intellectual growth. It asserts that every individual should have the
    opportunity to learn, understand, and contribute to the collective pool of
    human knowledge, without limitations imposed by socioeconomic status,
    geography, or institutional gatekeeping.
</p>
<p>
    This directive calls for a radical rethinking of educational systems,
    advocating for a shift from traditional, hierarchical models of instruction
    to more decentralized, collaborative, and personalized forms of learning.
    The aim is to cultivate a culture where curiosity and critical thinking are
    nurtured, allowing for a more adaptable and resilient society
</p>
<p>
    The directive emphasizes the role of technology not just as a tool for
    disseminating information but as a means to enhance cognitive capabilities
    and create new forms of knowledge interaction. It envisions a future where
    augmented reality, virtual spaces, and AI-driven platforms provide immersive
    and interactive learning experiences, making the acquisition of knowledge a
    more engaging and effective process.
